# Cube
Cube is a web-based chat application designed exclusively for educational institutes grappling with the challenges of managing multiple groups. With its real-time capabilities, Cube transforms the way students and educators collaborate, fostering seamless communication and efficient information exchange.

We have all witnessed the evolution of communication methods from letters to chatrooms and nowadays the use of chat applications is quite popular.However, a person's relationships and groups have substantially risen, and this is especially true for those who work in the educational field.Let's use engineering CLGS as an example to illustrate the increase in number of groups, educators start chat groups to better connect with the students, but as they take on more classes, the number of group grows each year and the same is true for students as each passing year they are made to join multiple groups.Even in a group there are multiple types of messages like announcements about exams,holidays, time-table as well as doubts to name a few these messages are quite frequent and the important ones are lost in this clutter making it quite a pain to search for the message we need at the moment from that heap of messages.Our app Cube resolves this common problem by introducing sub-grouping.
